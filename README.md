# Running The Solutions
You can run the solutions with `./gradlew run`. This will print out all of the solutions.

You can also check them for accuracy by using `./gradlew test`.

The ideal workflow is to copy the input files into resources, then make a new object for the Day of the puzzle along with a test that asserts your samples are correct.
